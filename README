How to use these theories in Isabelle:

Download the theories from this github.
Download the following category theory library:
https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Category3.html

Extract the files from this github into some folder.
Extract the category theory library files into some folder.
Add the name of both folders to the "ROOTS" file of Isabelle.

Start Isabelle
Switch the Logic to "CategoryAndHomology"
Restart Isabelle

The first time you do this, Isabelle will create a persistent heap image of all the category theory and homology theory files, which might take a while.

Once Isabelle is using the "CategoryAndHomology" logic, all the theory files from this github should compile without error.
