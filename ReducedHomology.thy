(*TODO: Define reduced homology of pointed simplicial sets with coefficients in an abelian group*)
(*Steps: - Define a category of abelian groups
         - Define a free abelian group functor
         - Define a tensor product functor
         - Define algebraic homology of simplicial abelian groups 
             (i.e. functors from Delta Op to the category of abelian groups) *)
